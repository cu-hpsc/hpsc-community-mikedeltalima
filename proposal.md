# Community Software Analysis Proposal

## Software: *Dask*

Dask is a software package that extends popular data libraries in Python such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn to allow scalable parallel computation. Dask uses dynamic task scheduling to allow execution on these extended data collections in distributed environments. This means that tasks are scheduled according to a task graph dynamically created by the scheduler as requests for computation arrive.
